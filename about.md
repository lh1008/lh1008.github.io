# about lh1008

<br>Since 2016 I've been contributing to the open-source <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/" target="_blank">Monero Project</a>. Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency project led by volunteers. From 2018 to 2021 I roled as Communication Workgroup Coordinator. You can take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/monero-ecosystem/outreach-docs" target="_blank">Monero Outreach's Workgroup</a> repository. My main tasks were to lead the localization workgroup (translations) and as IT assistant. I'm currently involved in community building from Telegram.

<br>I started my software engineer career at <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a>. I learned progamming fundamentals and blockchain technology with C programming language. 

<br>I'm currently expanding my software engineering expertise and working at [Addi](https://co.addi.com/) as **Support Engineer** since 2021. I'm a very challenge motivated person.
