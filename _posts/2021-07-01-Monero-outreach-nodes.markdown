# rpc-node.monerooutreach
The **RPC-pay Monero Outreach** public node project was a project that had a public RPC Monero node enabled that could reach the Monero Blockchain through RPC calls. The RPC-Monero Outhreach node enabled the new RPC payment system using mining hashes. Read more about the RPC payment system directly from the: <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/monero/commit/2899379791b7542e4eb920b5d9d58cf232806937" target="_blank">commit</a>
