# blockchain labb
**Blockchain Labb** was an NFT marketplace startup. We designed and built Blockchain Labb's architecture from its original idea. From an IT blockchain consultant site into an NFT marketplace.

I was the lead team full-stack Software Engineer. Lead a team of 2 developers to build and design Blockchain Labb's MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The project was built on Node.js.
